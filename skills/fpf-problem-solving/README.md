AI coding agent skill for the [First Principles Framework (FPF)](https://github.com/ailev/FPF) by [Anatoly Levenchuk](https://github.com/ailev).

FPF is a transdisciplinary reasoning architecture for systems engineering, knowledge coordination, and mixed human/AI teams.

FPF is a **thinking amplifier** — it helps you plan deeper and make better decisions by systematically exploring relevant alternatives instead of anchoring on the first idea.

## How it works

This skill functions as **agentic RAG** — retrieval-augmented generation driven by the agent itself, with no external vector database or embedding pipeline. The 82,000-line FPF specification is split into a two-level hierarchy (20 directories, 269 files). SKILL.md provides a thinking-verb router that maps the user's intent to the right section. The agent then navigates `_index.md` files to pick the narrowest sub-section (~300 lines) and loads only that into context. The agent is the retriever, the router, and the reasoner — all in one loop.

  ...                                  # 20 directories total
```

The agent reads `_index.md` first, picks the right sub-section file, and loads only that.

## Updating after FPF spec changes

When the upstream FPF specification changes, two things need updating:

### 1. Regenerate section files

Pull the submodule and re-run the splitter to rebuild the `sections/` hierarchy:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
python3 scripts/split_spec.py
```

### 2. Update SKILL.md navigation

The section files are raw content — `SKILL.md` is the navigation layer on top.
After regenerating, review whether the thinking-verb router, use cases, or Section INDEX
in `SKILL.md` need updating to reflect new, changed, or removed content.

See **[FPF-SKILL-UPDATE-GUIDE.md](FPF-SKILL-UPDATE-GUIDE.md)** for the full
methodology: what to check, how to validate router entries, and how to run an FPF self-audit
on the skill file itself.

> **Note:** the `FPF` submodule temporarily tracks a fork ([rodion-m/FPF](https://github.com/rodion-m/FPF), branch `fix/restore-orphaned-part-headings`) that restores the Part D/E/F/G section headings accidentally deleted upstream — see [ailev/FPF#42](https://github.com/ailev/FPF/issues/42) and [PR #43](https://github.com/ailev/FPF/pull/43). It will be re-pinned to upstream `ailev/FPF` once the PR is merged.
