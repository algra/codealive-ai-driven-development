# Chapter 5: Patterns and Troubleshooting

These patterns emerged from skills created by early adopters and internal teams.

## Choosing your approach: Problem-first vs. tool-first

- **Problem-first:** "I need to set up a project workspace" — Your skill orchestrates the right MCP calls in the right sequence. Users describe outcomes; the skill handles the tools.
- **Tool-first:** "I have Notion MCP connected" — Your skill teaches Claude the optimal workflows and best practices. Users have access; the skill provides expertise.

## Pattern 1: Sequential workflow orchestration

**Use when:** Your users need multi-step processes in a specific order.

```markdown
## Workflow: Onboard New Customer

### Step 1: Create Account
Call MCP tool: `create_customer`
Parameters: name, email, company

### Step 2: Setup Payment
Call MCP tool: `setup_payment_method`
Wait for: payment method verification

### Step 3: Create Subscription
Call MCP tool: `create_subscription`
Parameters: plan_id, customer_id (from Step 1)

### Step 4: Send Welcome Email
Call MCP tool: `send_email`
Template: welcome_email_template
```

Key techniques:
- Explicit step ordering
- Dependencies between steps
- Validation at each stage
- Rollback instructions for failures

## Pattern 2: Multi-MCP coordination

**Use when:** Workflows span multiple services.

```markdown
### Phase 1: Design Export (Figma MCP)
1. Export design assets from Figma
2. Generate design specifications
3. Create asset manifest

### Phase 2: Asset Storage (Drive MCP)
1. Create project folder in Drive
2. Upload all assets
3. Generate shareable links

### Phase 3: Task Creation (Linear MCP)
1. Create development tasks
2. Attach asset links to tasks
3. Assign to engineering team

### Phase 4: Notification (Slack MCP)
1. Post handoff summary to #engineering
2. Include asset links and task references
```

Key techniques:
- Clear phase separation
- Data passing between MCPs
- Validation before moving to next phase
- Centralized error handling

## Pattern 3: Iterative refinement

**Use when:** Output quality improves with iteration.

```markdown
## Iterative Report Creation

### Initial Draft
1. Fetch data via MCP
2. Generate first draft report
3. Save to temporary file

### Quality Check
1. Run validation script: `scripts/check_report.py`
2. Identify issues:
   - Missing sections
   - Inconsistent formatting
   - Data validation errors

### Refinement Loop
1. Address each identified issue
2. Regenerate affected sections
3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until quality threshold met

### Finalization
1. Apply final formatting
2. Generate summary
3. Save final version
```

Key techniques:
- Explicit quality criteria
- Iterative improvement
- Validation scripts
- Know when to stop iterating

## Pattern 4: Context-aware tool selection

**Use when:** Same outcome, different tools depending on context.

```markdown
## Smart File Storage

### Decision Tree
1. Check file type and size
2. Determine best storage location:
   - Large files (>10MB): Use cloud storage MCP
   - Collaborative docs: Use Notion/Docs MCP
   - Code files: Use GitHub MCP
   - Temporary files: Use local storage

### Execute Storage
Based on decision:
- Call appropriate MCP tool
- Apply service-specific metadata
- Generate access link

### Provide Context to User
Explain why that storage was chosen
```

Key techniques:
- Clear decision criteria
- Fallback options
- Transparency about choices

## Pattern 6: Validated iterative refinement (SkillOpt-style)

**Use when:** A skill underperforms on a measurable task set and you can score outcomes.

This is Pattern 3 (iterative refinement) hardened with the SkillOpt discipline: bounded edits, held-out validation gate, rejected-edit buffer, and an epoch-boundary slow update. See `skill-optimization.md` and `../scripts/optimize_skill.py`.

```markdown
## Optimised skill loop

### Forward pass: rollout
1. Sample a rollout batch from train split
2. Run the frozen target agent with the current skill on each task
3. Collect (trajectory, score) per task

### Backward pass: reflection
1. Split rollouts into failures / successes
2. Partition each into minibatches (default 8)
3. Optimiser proposes AT MOST L_t atomic edits per minibatch
   (operations: append, insert_after, replace, delete)
4. Merge hierarchically: failure → success → final
5. Rank and clip to L_t

### Bounded apply
1. Apply edits to a candidate skill
2. NEVER touch content between <!-- SLOW_UPDATE_START --> and <!-- SLOW_UPDATE_END -->

### Validation gate
1. Evaluate candidate on selection split
2. Accept only if STRICTLY greater than current score
3. Else: store edits + failure summary in rejected_buffer.json

### Epoch boundary (e >= 2)
1. Slow update: compare same tasks under previous and current skill,
   write longitudinal guidance into the protected section
2. Optimiser meta-skill: capture which edit patterns helped vs hurt
   (optimiser-side only — never shipped)

### Final
1. Report best skill on the test split
2. Export best_skill.md + optimization_report.md
```

Key techniques:
- Strict-greater gate prevents silent drift on ties
- Rejected buffer feeds back into the next optimiser call in the same epoch
- Bounded `L_t` (default 4 with cosine decay to floor 2) preserves continuity between revisions
- Slow-update lives in a protected region — step edits cannot overwrite durable lessons
- Final artefact stays compact (target 300-2000 tokens) and procedural rather than instance-specific

**Anti-pattern: blind rewrites.** Without an edit budget, the optimiser erases useful rules; without a strict-greater gate, candidates that tie the current score get silently accepted; without a rejected buffer, the same bad edit gets re-proposed every step. Removing any one component costs measurable accuracy (Table 3 of the paper).

## Pattern 7: Domain-specific intelligence (was Pattern 5)

**Use when:** Your skill adds specialized knowledge beyond tool access.

```markdown
## Payment Processing with Compliance

### Before Processing (Compliance Check)
1. Fetch transaction details via MCP
2. Apply compliance rules:
   - Check sanctions lists
   - Verify jurisdiction allowances
   - Assess risk level
3. Document compliance decision

### Processing
IF compliance passed:
- Call payment processing MCP tool
- Apply appropriate fraud checks
- Process transaction
ELSE:
- Flag for review
- Create compliance case

### Audit Trail
- Log all compliance checks
- Record processing decisions
- Generate audit report
```

Key techniques:
- Domain expertise embedded in logic
- Compliance before action
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear governance

## Troubleshooting

### Skill won't upload

**Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder"**
- Cause: File not named exactly SKILL.md
- Solution: Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive). Verify with: `ls -la` should show SKILL.md

**Error: "Invalid frontmatter"**
- Cause: YAML formatting issue

```yaml
# Wrong - missing delimiters
name: my-skill
description: Does things

# Wrong - unclosed quotes
name: my-skill
description: "Does things

# Correct
---
name: my-skill
description: Does things
---
```

**Error: "Invalid skill name"**
- Cause: Name has spaces or capitals

```yaml
# Wrong
name: My Cool Skill

# Correct
name: my-cool-skill
```

### Skill doesn't trigger

Symptom: Skill never loads automatically.

Fix: Revise your description field.

Quick checklist:
- Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" won't work)
- Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?
- Does it mention relevant file types if applicable?

Debugging approach: Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the description back. Adjust based on what's missing.

### Skill triggers too often

Symptom: Skill loads for unrelated queries.

Solutions:

1. Add negative triggers:
```yaml
description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files. Use for statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).
```

2. Be more specific:
```yaml
# Too broad
description: Processes documents

# More specific
description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review
```

3. Clarify scope:
```yaml
description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use specifically for online payment workflows, not for general financial queries.
```

### MCP connection issues

Symptom: Skill loads but MCP calls fail.

Checklist:
1. Verify MCP server is connected (Claude.ai: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service])
2. Check authentication (API keys valid, proper permissions, OAuth tokens refreshed)
3. Test MCP independently ("Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects" - if this fails, issue is MCP not skill)
4. Verify tool names (case-sensitive, check MCP server documentation)

### Instructions not followed

Symptom: Skill loads but Claude doesn't follow instructions.

Common causes:

1. **Instructions too verbose** - Keep concise, use bullet points, move detailed reference to separate files
2. **Instructions buried** - Put critical instructions at the top, use `## Important` or `## Critical` headers
3. **Ambiguous language:**

```markdown
# Bad
Make sure to validate things properly

# Good
CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:
- Project name is non-empty
- At least one team member assigned
- Start date is not in the past
```

**Advanced technique:** For critical validations, consider bundling a script that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't.

4. **Model "laziness"** - Add explicit encouragement:

```markdown
## Performance Notes
- Take your time to do this thoroughly
- Quality is more important than speed
- Do not skip validation steps
```

Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md.

### Large context issues

Symptom: Skill seems slow or responses degraded.

Causes:
- Skill content too large
- Too many skills enabled simultaneously
- All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure

Solutions:
1. Optimize SKILL.md size - move detailed docs to references/, keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words
2. Reduce enabled skills - evaluate if you have more than 20-50 skills enabled simultaneously
